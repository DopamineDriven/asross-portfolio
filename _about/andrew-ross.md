# About
Prior to entering tech, I earned BA and BS degrees from the University of Iowa in Biochemistry and Bio Anthropology, respectively. Go Hawks! üè¥ After working as an industrial engineer at UPS, I decided to enroll in Northwestern's full-stack development program. Shortly after graduating, Windy City Devs LLC was conceived, and I have been acting CTO since. In addition to freelance, I am also a remote TA for a full-stack cohort at Vanderbilt.

Outside of tech, I love snowboarding by Winter and wakeboarding by Summer. Real-time strategy games have been a favorite since 14 with my poison of preference being Age of Empires III. I am eager to explore more of the world and am open to relocation, be it intra- or internationally. I'm so glad you decided to stop by and endure the tech-talk to arrive at this point! This journey's just getting started so drop me a line; let's build something remarkable together.
